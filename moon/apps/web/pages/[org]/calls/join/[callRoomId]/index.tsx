/*
 * In the Desktop app, this hook prevents calls opened from links outside of the app from hijacking the main window.
 * We try to intercept call links from outside of the app by listening for ToDesktop's openProtocolUrl event, but
 * there are two cases when we need to fallback to this hook:
 *
 * 1. When a user clicks a call link outside of the app and the Desktop app is not already open, we haven't
 *    subscribed to the openProtocolUrl event before hitting this route.
 * 2. Sometimes, we aren't able to preventDefault() in the openProtocolUrl event handler before this route loads.
 *    We're not sure why this happens, and we can't reproduce it consistently.
