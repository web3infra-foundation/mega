/// Generic parser traits. If users want to customize the configuration file parser, they must implement this trait.
/// The yaml module's `YamlParser` is an example.
pub trait Parser {
    /// Parses the contents of a configuration file into a series of tasks with dependencies.
    /// Parameter Description:
    /// - file: path information of the configuration file
    /// - specific_actions: When parsing the configuration file, the specific execution logic
    ///   of some tasks does not need to be specified in the configuration file, but is given
    ///   through this map. In the map's key-value pair, the key represents the unique identifier
    ///   of the task in the task's configuration file, and the value represents the execution
    ///   logic given by the user.
    ///
    /// Return value description:
    /// If an error is encountered during the parsing process, the return result is ParserError.
    /// Instead, return a series of concrete types that implement the [`Task`] trait.
    /// This may involve user-defined [`Task`], you can refer to `YamlTask` under the yaml module.
