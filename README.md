# Mega - is an unofficial open source implementation of Google Piper.

Mega is an unofficial open source implementation of Google Piper. It is a monorepo & monolithic codebase management system that supports Git. Mega is designed to manage large-scale codebases, streamline development, and foster collaboration.

## What's the Piper?

Google Piper is a massive, centralized version control system that Google uses internally to manage their vast codebase. It is a monorepo, and a monolithic which mean is a single repository that contains all the source code for Google's software. It is designed to manage large-scale codebases, streamline development, and foster collaboration. It is built on top of Google's internal infrastructure and is designed to be highly scalable and efficient. More information on the [Why Google Stores Billions of Lines of Code in a Single Repository](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext).

**Google Piper is not open source**

## Mega features

Mega is an unofficial open source implementation of Google Piper. And it has the following features:

### Git compatible

Mega offers the ability to utilize Git with a monorepo. This allows for easy cloning or pulling of any monorepo folder into local filesystem as a Git repository, and seamless pushing of changes back.

### Trunk-based Development

When it comes to managing large codebases in a centralized manner, trunk-based development is the way to go. More trunk-based Development information on the [Trunk-Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/).

### Conventional Commits

Mega will support conventional commits, which are a set of rules for creating clear and concise commit messages.  More information on the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

### Code Owners

Mega will support code owners, which are a set of rules for defining who owns a particular piece of code. More information on the [Code Owners](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-code-owners).

### Decentralized Open Source Collaboration

For now, the entire open source community base on Git and GitHub. It's centralized model, and it's not suitable for growing speed of open source world. Mega is working on build a decentralized open source collaboration model with [ZTM](https://github.com/flomesh-io/ztm)(Zero Trust Model) and decentralized social network like [Nostr](https://nostr.com), [Matrix](https://matrix.org) and [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org).

## Quick Try Monorepo Engine with Docker

For now, the monorepo engine could be deployed on your host machine or insulated into containers. For deploying through docker, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the project and build the docker images
```bash
git clone https://github.com/web3infra-foundation/mega.git
cd mega
git submodule update --init --recursive
docker buildx build -t mono-pg:0.1-pre-release -f ./docker/mono-pg-dockerfile .
docker buildx build -t mono-engine:0.1-pre-release -f ./docker/mono-engine-dockerfile .
docker buildx build -t mono-ui:0.1-pre-release -f ./docker/mono-ui-dockerfile .
```

2. Initialize for mono-engine and PostgreSQL
```bash
# Linux or MacOS
./docker/init-volume.sh /mnt/data ./docker/config.toml
```

3. Run the mono-engine and PostgreSQL with docker, and open the mono-ui in your browser with `http://localhost:3000`.
```bash
# create network
docker network create mono-network

# run postgres
docker run --rm -it -d --name mono-pg --network mono-network -v /tmp/data/mono/pg-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data -p 5432:5432 mono-pg:0.1-pre-release
docker run --rm -it -d --name mono-engine --network mono-network -v /tmp/data/mono/mono-data:/opt/mega -p 8000:8000 mono-engine:0.1-pre-release
docker run --rm -it -d --name mono-ui --network mono-network -e MEGA_INTERNAL_HOST=http://mono-engine:8000 -e MEGA_HOST=http://localhost:8000 -p 3000:3000 mono-ui:0.1-pre-release
```

4. Try to upload a repository to mono-engine
```bash
git clone http://localhost:8000/project.git
cd project
git clone https://github.com/dagrs-dev/dagrs.git
sudo rm -r dagrs/.git
git add .
git commit -a -m"Initial the dagrs project"
git push
```

5. Check the repository in UI
Open the mono-ui in your browser with `http://localhost:3000`, and you will see the `project` folder.
