      # 1. Under git protocol v2, refs/pull/* may not be discoverable if not in
      #    the configured fetch refspec (causes "couldn't find remote ref")
      # 2. If a local branch pr-N already exists and is checked out, git refuses
      #    to fetch into it (causes "refusing to fetch into branch")
      # Adding refs/pull/*/head to the fetch refspec solves issue 1, and we avoid
      # creating local branches to prevent issue 2.

            Perform a comprehensive code review with the following focus areas:

            1. **Code Quality**
               - Clean code principles and best practices
               - Proper error handling and edge cases
               - Code readability and maintainability

            2. **Security**
               - Check for potential security vulnerabilities
               - Validate input sanitization
               - Review authentication/authorization logic

            3. **Performance**
               - Identify potential performance bottlenecks
               - Review database queries for efficiency
               - Check for memory leaks or resource issues

            4. **Testing**
               - Verify adequate test coverage
               - Review test quality and edge cases
               - Check for missing test scenarios

            5. **Documentation**
               - Ensure code is properly documented
               - Verify README updates for new features
               - Check API documentation accuracy

            Provide detailed feedback using inline comments for specific issues.
            Use top-level comments for general observations or praise.
