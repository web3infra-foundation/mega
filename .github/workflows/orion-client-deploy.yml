      # NOTE:
      # The legacy orion_vm was provisioned with root-only SSH access.
      # For backward compatibility and to avoid breaking existing
      # production automation, deployment continues to use the root user.
      #
      # The new GCP VM correctly uses a non-root `orion` user.
      # Future infrastructure revisions should migrate orion_vm
      # to a least-privilege deployment user.
