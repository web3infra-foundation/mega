    The `status` command now supports the `--porcelain` option for machine-readable output format.

</Note>

### Options

- `--porcelain`
    Provide output in a stable, easy-to-parse format for scripts.
    Each line of output contains two status columns followed by the file path:
    First column = index status (changes staged for commit)
    Second column = working tree status (changes not staged)
    Status codes:
    A = Added
    M = Modified
    D = Deleted
    ?? = Untracked
    When --porcelain is not provided, the default human-readable output format is used.
