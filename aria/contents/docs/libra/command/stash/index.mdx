title: The [stash] Command
description: Stash the changes in a dirty working directory away
---

### Usage

libra stash `<subcommand>` \[OPTIONS\] \[STASH\]

### Description

Use `libra stash` when you want to record the current state of the working directory and the index, but want to go back to a clean working directory. The command saves your local modifications away and reverts the working directory to match the `HEAD` commit.

The modifications stashed away by this command can be listed with `libra stash list`, inspected with `libra stash show`, and restored (potentially on top of a different commit) with `libra stash apply`. Calling `libra stash` without any arguments is equivalent to `libra stash push`.

### Subcommands

-   **`push [-m | --message <message>]`**
    Save your local modifications to a new stash entry and roll back to the `HEAD` commit. The `<message>` part is optional and gives the description along with the stashed state.

-   **`pop [stash]`**
    Remove a single stashed state from the stash list and apply it on top of the current working tree state. If no `stash` is given, it defaults to the latest one (`stash@{0}`).

-   **`list`**
    List the stash entries that you currently have. Each stash entry is listed with its name (e.g. `stash@{0}`) and the description from when it was created.

-   **`apply [stash]`**
    Like `pop`, but do not remove the stashed state from the stash list. If no `stash` is given, it defaults to the latest one (`stash@{0}`).

-   **`drop [stash]`**
    Remove a single stashed state from the stash list. If no `stash` is given, it defaults to the latest one (`stash@{0}`).

### Arguments

-   `[STASH]`
    A reference to a specific stash. The syntax is `stash@{<revision>}` (e.g., `stash@{0}` for the latest stash, `stash@{1}` for the one before, etc.). If not specified, the command defaults to the latest stash.
