title: The [reset] Command
description: Reset current HEAD to the specified state
---

### Usage

libra reset [OPTIONS] [COMMIT] [--] [PATHSPEC]...

### Arguments

- [COMMIT] - The commit to reset to. Can be a commit hash, branch name, or a reference like HEAD. Defaults to HEAD if not specified.
- [PATHSPEC]... - One or more file paths to reset. When specified, the reset operation only affects the index for these files, not the HEAD.

### Description

This command has two primary forms.

In the first form, it resets the current branch head (HEAD) to [COMMIT] and possibly updates the index (staging area) and the working tree, depending on the chosen mode.

- --soft – Does not touch the index file or the working tree at all. It only resets the HEAD to point to the given commit.
- --mixed – Resets the index but not the working tree. This is the default mode. All changes are kept in the working directory but are unstaged.
- --hard – Resets the index and working tree. Any changes to tracked files in the working tree since the target [COMMIT] are discarded.

In the second form, if one or more [PATHSPEC] arguments are given, the command does not move the HEAD pointer. Instead, it resets the index entries for the specified paths to their state at the given [COMMIT]. This is commonly used to unstage changes.

### Options

- --soft
  Performs a soft reset. Only the HEAD pointer is moved. The index and working directory are not changed.
- --mixed
  Performs a mixed reset. The HEAD pointer is moved and the index is reset to match. Changes in the working directory are kept but unstaged. This is the default mode.
- --hard
  Performs a hard reset. The HEAD pointer, index, and working directory are all reset to match the specified commit. All local changes are lost.
- -h, --help
  Print help
### Example
- libra reset --soft/mixed/hard commit
- libra reset HEAD -- 1.txt 2.txt
