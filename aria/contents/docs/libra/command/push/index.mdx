title: The [push] Command
description: Update remote refs along with associated objects
---

### Usage

libra push \[OPTIONS\] \[REPOSITORY\] \[REFSPEC\]

### Arguments

-   `[REPOSITORY]` - repository, e.g. origin
-   `[REFSPEC]` - ref to push, e.g. master

### Description

Updates remote refs using local refs, while sending objects necessary to complete the given refs.

When the command line does not specify where to push with the `<repository>` argument, `branch.*.remote` configuration for the current branch is consulted to determine where to push.

When the command line does not specify what to push with `<refspec>` argument, current branch is pushed.

### Options

-   `-u`, `--set-upstream`
    For every branch that is up to date or successfully pushed, add upstream (tracking) reference,
    used by argument-less `libra pull` and other commands.
