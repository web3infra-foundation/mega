title: The [fetch] Command
description: Download objects and refs from another repository
---

### Usage

libra fetch [OPTIONS] [REPOSITORY] [REFSPEC]

### Arguments

-   `[REPOSITORY]` - Repository to fetch from
-   `[REFSPEC]` - Refspec to fetch, usually a branch name

### Description

Fetch branches from one or more other repositories, along with the objects necessary to complete their histories. Remote-tracking branches are updated.

When no remote is specified, by default the current branch's config remote is used (normally `origin`). If the current branch is not associated with a remote, the command fails.

`fetch` is automatically invoked by `libra pull` and `libra push`.

### Options

-   `-a`, `--all`
     Fetch all remotes
-   `-h`, `--help`

<Note type="note" title="Note">
    Git-fetch could also be used be fetch tags, but currently, libra didn't
    support tag. Simple usage is same as git-fetch. Refs
