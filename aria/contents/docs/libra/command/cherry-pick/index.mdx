title: The [cherry-pick] Command
description: Apply the changes introduced by some existing commits
---

### Usage

libra cherry-pick [OPTIONS] <COMMIT>...

### Arguments

-   <COMMIT>... - Commits to cherry-pick.

### Description

Given one or more existing commits, apply the change that each one introduces, recording a new commit for each. This is useful for selectively applying commits from one branch to another without merging the entire branch.

For each commit specified, cherry-pick will calculate the difference between that commit and its parent, and then apply that patch onto the current branch's HEAD. A new commit is created with the same log message as the original commit, but with a new commit ID.

If a conflict occurs, the operation will stop, and the user must resolve the conflicts before committing the changes manually.

### Options

-   -n, --no-commit<br/>
    Usually, the command automatically creates a sequence of commits. This flag applies the changes necessary to cherry-pick each named commit to the working tree and the index, but does not make the commit. This allows you to inspect and modify the result of the cherry-pick before committing.

### Example

 \- libra cherry-pick commit1 -n
 \- libra cherry-pick commit2 commit3
