title: The [restore] Command
description: Restore working tree files
---

### Usage

libra restore \[OPTIONS\] \<PATHSPEC\>...

### Arguments

-   `<PATHSPEC>...` - files or dir to restore

### Description

Restore specified paths in the working tree with some contents from a restore source.
If a path is tracked but does not exist in the restore source, it will be removed to match the source.

The command can also be used to restore the content in the index with `--staged`,
or restore both the working tree and the index with `--staged` `--worktree`.

By default, if `--staged` is given, the contents are restored from `HEAD`, otherwise from the index.
Use `--source` to restore from a different commit.

### Options

-   `-s <SOURCE>`, `--source <SOURCE>`<br/>
    Restore the working tree files with the content from the given tree. It is common to specify the source tree by naming a commit, branch
    or tag associated with it.

    If not specified, the contents are restored from HEAD if `--staged` is given, otherwise from the index.

-   `-W`, `--worktree`, `-S`, `--staged`<br/>
    Specify the restore location. If neither option is specified, by default the working tree is restored. Specifying `--staged` will only
    restore the index. Specifying both restores both.
