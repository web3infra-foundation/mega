title: The [revert] Command
description: Create a new commit that reverts the changes of an existing commit
---

### Usage

libra revert [OPTIONS] <COMMIT>

### Arguments

- <COMMIT> - (Required) The commit to revert. Can be a commit hash, branch name, or a reference like HEAD.

### Description

Given one existing commit, this command creates a new commit that applies the inverse of the changes introduced by the specified commit. This effectively "undoes" the target commit.

Unlike libra reset, which alters the existing commit history, libra revert does not change the project history. Instead, it adds a new commit at the tip of the branch with the inverted content. This makes it a safe operation for reverting changes on a public or shared branch, as it preserves the original history.

By default, a new commit is created with a message indicating which commit was reverted.

This implementation does not support reverting merge commits. The command must be run from a branch, not a 'detached HEAD' state.

### Options

- -n, --no-commit
  Performs the revert operation by applying the inverse changes to the working directory and index, but does not create a new commit. The changes will be staged, allowing you to inspect or modify them before committing manually.
- -h, --help
  Print help
### Example
- libra revert HEAD~2

  Creates a new commit that undoes the changes made two commits before the current HEAD.

- libra revert -n a1b2c3d4

  Applies the inverse of the changes from commit a1b2c3d4 to the index, but does not commit them, leaving them staged.
