title: The [branch] Command
description: List, create, or delete branches
---

### Usage

libra branch [OPTIONS] [NEW_BRANCH] [COMMIT_HASH]

### Arguments

-   `[NEW_BRANCH]` - New branch name
-   `[COMMIT_HASH]` - Base branch name or commit hash

### Description

If --list is given, or if there are no non-option arguments, existing local branches are listed; the current branch will be highlighted in green and marked with an asterisk, same as git.

If a new branch name is given, a new branch is created that points to the given commit hash. If no commit hash is given, the new branch will point to the current commit.

### Options

-   `-l`, `--list`
    List all branches, don't include remote branches. The order is not guaranteed, mostly it is sorted by the created order.
-   `-D`, `--delete <DELETE>`
    Force delete branch
-   `-u`, `--set-upstream-to <SET_UPSTREAM_TO>`
    Set up `<branchname>`'s tracking information so `<upstream>` is considered `<branchname>`'s upstream branch.
-   `--show-current`
    Show current branch
-   `-r`, `--remotes`
    Show remote branches
-   `-h`, `--help`
    Print help
