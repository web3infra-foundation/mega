title: The [rm] Command
description: Remove files from the working tree and from the index
---

### Usage

libra rm \[OPTIONS\] \[PATHSPEC\]...

### Arguments

-   `[PATHSPEC]...` - Files to remove.<br/>
A leading directory name can be given to remove all files in the
directory, and recursively all sub-directories, but this requires the `-r` option to be explicitly given.

### Description

Remove files matching pathspec from the index, or from the working tree and the index. `libra rm` will not remove a file from just your working
directory. (There is no option to remove a file only from the working tree and yet keep it in the index; use system rm if you want to do
that.)

### Options

-   `--cached`<br/>
    Use this option to unstage and remove paths only from the index. Working tree files, whether modified or not, will be left alone.

-   `-r`, `--recursive`<br/>
    Allow recursive removal when a leading directory name is given.

-   `-f`, `--force`<br/>
    Force removal even if the specified paths are not tracked. This skips validation checks and deletes files or directories regardless of their index status.
