Follow these simple instructions to set up your project efficiently and begin creating content without delay!:

## Documentation

1. **Configure Routing**
   - Open the `@lib/route-config.ts` file and add your routing pages:
     ```typescript
     export const ROUTES: EachRoute[] = [
         // Add new route below
         {
             title: "Fundamentals",
             href: "/fundamentals",
             noLink: true, // Set to true to prevent routing
             items: [
                 // All the sub-sections under `fundamentals`
                 { title: "HTTP Server", href: "/http-server" },
             ],
         },
     ];
     ```

2. **Create Content Structure**
   - Navigate to the `@content/docs` directory and create a folder named `fundamentals`, as defined in the `route-config` file. Within this folder, create a subfolder named `http-server`, and inside that, create an `index.mdx` file that will render when you navigate to `/fundamentals/http-server`:
     ```plaintext
     root
     ├── content/docs
     │   └── fundamentals
     │       └── http-server
     │           └── index.mdx
     ```

3. **Write Your Markdown Content**
   - Start writing your markdown content inside the `index.mdx` file. Be sure to include frontmatter at the beginning of the file, which is used for the page title and description:
     ```markdown showLineNumbers {1-4}
     --- 
     title: HTTP Server
     description: This section is about HTTP Server.
     ---

     <!-- Here goes your markdown content -->
     ```

4. **Run Your Application**
   - Ensure your application is running. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/docs/fundamentals/http-server` to view your content. You should also see it in the left panel, allowing you to navigate to other pages.


## Blogs

To get started with blogs, follow these steps:

- Navigate to the `@content/blogs` directory and create a file with a unique name prefixed with `.mdx`, then start writing the markdown content inside.

- Make sure to add the following frontmatter to format data for the blogs properly:
  ```markdown

- Navigate to your local development server at `http://localhost:3000/blog`, where you will see your blog listed and sorted based on date. You can navigate to any blog to read it.

## LFS Usage Configuration

1. **Why you need to do this?**

By default, Git LFS will append .git/info/lfs to the end of a Git remote url to build the LFS server URL it will use:
```bash
Git Remote: https://git-server.com/foo/bar
LFS Server: https://git-server.com/foo/bar.git/info/lfs

Git Remote: https://git-server.com/foo/bar.git
LFS Server: https://git-server.com/foo/bar.git/info/lfs
```
see more details at [LFS doc](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/docs/api/server-discovery.md)

Because Mega uses a monorepo with multiple layers of paths, LFS by default appends parameters to the request path. However, Axum’s support for wildcard paths is not sufficiently robust, making it difficult to include wildcards `(*)` in nested routes. Adapting wildcard `(*)` routes has become a challenging task.

Therefore, we need to manually configure the LFS server’s address so that all requests start from the server’s root route. This simplifies the implementation of this part of the work.

1. **Configure LFS Server URL for a Specific Repository**

Go to your repository folder, set:
```bash
git config lfs.url https://git.gitmega.dev
```

Or manually edit the .git/config file in your repository and add or modify the lfs.url entry:

```bash
[remote "origin"]
    url = https://git.gitmega.dev/your-repo.git

[lfs]
    url = https://git.gitmega.dev
```

3. **Set a Global LFS Server URL**

To specify a global LFS server URL for all repositories, update your global Git configuration:

```bash
git config --global lfs.url https://git.gitmega.dev
```
Alternatively, directly edit the global configuration file ~/.gitconfig and add:

```bash
[lfs]
    url = https://git.gitmega.dev
```

<Note type="warning" title="Note">
If you choose to modify the global configuration, remember to remove the global LFS server configuration after testing Mega to ensure that the original SCM LFS service (e.g., GitHub) functions properly.
