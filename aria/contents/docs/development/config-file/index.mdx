title: Configuration File
description: Config `config.toml` file for the Mega project.
---


## Path
- Default: automatically load `config.toml` in current directory.
- Specify manually: use `--config "/path/to/config.toml"`

## Enhance
- You can use environment variables starting with `MEGA_` to override the configuration in `config.toml`.
  - like `MEGA_BASE_DIR` to override `base_dir`. // with `env::set_var()`
  - use separator `__` (2 \* `_`) for nested keys, like `MEGA_LOG__LOG_PATH` for `log.log_path`.
- Support `${}` syntax to reference other keys in the same file.
  - like `log_path = "${base_dir}/logs"`, `${base_dir}` will be replaced by the value of `base_dir`
  - or `key = "${xxx.yyy}/zzz"` (prefix `xxx.` can't be omitted)
  - only support `String` type
  - substitute from up to down
  - see codes in [config.rs](/common/src/config.rs)
