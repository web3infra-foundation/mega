## Database maintenance
Currently, the tables of database are created by [SeaORM migration](https://www.sea-ql.org/SeaORM/docs/migration/setting-up-migration). 

If you want to add a new table or modify the existing table, you need to update the `migration` files which are located in the `jupiter/migration/src` directory.

### Attention
- DO NOT use `Array` Type in PostgreSQL but use `JSON` instead, for compatibility with SQLite & MySQL. (`JSON` &lt;==&gt; `serde_json::Value`)
