/**
 * Error object (to be used as `Result<T, MPRError>`) for mount-point-related errors (hence MPR).
 * Includes a description (that is auto-generated from the `io::Error` at first), which can be
 * overridden with `MPRError::set_desc()`, or given a prefix with `MPRError::prefix()`.
 *
 * The full description can be retrieved through the `Display` trait implementation (or the
 * auto-derived `ToString`).
 *
 * `MPRError` objects should generally be logged at some point, because they may indicate an error
 * in the user's configuration or a bug in virtiofsd.  However, we only want to log them once per
 * filesystem, and so they can be silenced (setting `silent` to true if we know that we have
 * already logged an error for the respective filesystem) and then should not be logged.
 *
 * Naturally, a "mount-point-related" error should be associated with some mount point, which is
 * reflected in `fs_mount_id` and `fs_mount_root`.  Setting these values will improve the error
 * description, because the `Display` implementation will prepend these values to the returned
 * string.
 *
 * To achieve this association, `MPRError` objects should be created through
 * `MountFds::error_for()`, which obtains the mount root path for the given mount ID, and will thus
 * try to not only set `fs_mount_id`, but `fs_mount_root` also.  `MountFds::error_for()` will also
 * take care to set `silent` as appropriate.
 *
 * (Sometimes, though, we know an error is associated with a mount point, but we do not know with
 * which one.  That is why the `fs_mount_id` field is optional.)
