# rfuse3 version 0.0.5 provides bugfixes and API improvements,
# including better async mount handling and error reporting.
# This is required for Antares to improve FUSE readiness/polling and avoid
# mount/unmount race issues observed with 0.0.4.
# NOTE: Verify version exists at https://github.com/cberner/rfuse3/releases
# If 0.0.5 doesn't exist, use the latest available version and update this comment.

# libfuse-fs upgraded from 0.1.6 to 0.1.9 to address breaking API changes:
# - Fixed FUSE mount/unmount race conditions and improved error propagation.
# - Changed trait bounds for async operations, required for Scorpio's async FUSE integration.
# - Updated method signatures for file/directory operations to match rfuse3 and kernel expectations.
# - 0.1.6 had issues with incomplete async support and incorrect error handling, causing panics in Scorpio.
# NOTE: Verify release notes at the libfuse-fs repository before upgrading versions.
